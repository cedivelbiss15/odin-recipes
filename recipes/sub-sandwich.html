        <p><h5><em>A sub sandwich is easily customizable and great for lunch or dinner.</em></h5></p>

        <p>The submarine sandwich, or as we call it, the sub, is one of the most versatile foods known to man. While I highly recommend following this recipe step-by-step, feel free to customize this however you would like</p>
        <p>Nothing is better than a quality sub. The key is great ingredients and the right mindset. With those two things, you'll be equipped to make lunchtime something to behold.</p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A loaf of French white bread</li>
            <li>Turkey deli meat</li>
            <li>Muenster cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>Shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Banana peppers</li>
            <li>Sandwich spread</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the bread so that you have an even top and bottom half, I find it easier if you flip the roll over</li>
            <li>Lay your turkey on the bottom, folding the slices in half. You shouldn't be able to see the bread at all once you're done</li>
            <li>Lay your cheese on top, folding it half just like before</li>
            <li>Next, sprinkle your lettuce on top. You want a good bit but not too much</li>
            <li>Put your onions on top of the lettuce</li>
            <li>Lay your banana peppers on top. They're strong in flavor so don't use too many</li>
            <li>Put your spread on the bottom of the top slice of bread. The oil from the spread traps in the moisture of the veggies so that the bread doesn't get soggy</li>
            <li>Close the sandwich. Bam. You're done</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people out there will try and insult your sandwich. Don't let them get to you, they will die not knowing how good lunch can be.</p>
