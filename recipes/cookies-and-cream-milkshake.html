        <p><h5><em>Milkshakes are the best kind of desert, what we are making will not look like the picture. This is not a diner in the '50s.</em></h5></p>

        <p>Life is cruel. But a milkshake is always fun to drink and they taste great. There really isn't much else to say. Today we're gonna shake some milk.</p>
        <p>Also, milkshakes are stupid expensive. This is a great way to save like $6.</p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Cookies and cream ice cream, whatever brand you like</li>
            <li>Oreos</li>
            <li>A blender</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find the glass you want to drink out of, fill have with milk and pour it into the blender</li>
            <li>Eyeball the amount of ice cream, you probably want 1/4 of the cup to be ice cream. Toss it in the blender</li>
            <li>Toss a couple of oreos in there</li>
            <li>Blend</li>
            <li>If it's too thick, blend it again. You want to to be a little thick but also don't want it to be like water. Other than that, you're done.</li>
        </ol>
